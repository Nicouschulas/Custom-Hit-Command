## **❓ Q&A:**
**Why is the compiled plugin (JAR file) larger than the source code on GitHub?**

Our plugin includes **bStats** as a dependency to gather anonymous usage statistics. When the plugin is compiled into a single JAR file, the bStats library (along with all its own dependencies) is packaged directly into the final plugin file. This process, called 'shading', makes the plugin self-contained and ensures it runs smoothly without requiring users to download extra libraries, but it naturally increases the overall file size compared to just the raw source code.

## **🆘 Need Help?**
